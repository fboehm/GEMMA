\usage{
calc_gl_hat(Xmat, Vg, Ve, Dmat, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xmat}{a genotypes matrix for a single marker, dimension a by n, where a is the number of allelotypes and n the number of subjects}

\item{Vg}{current value of genetic covariance matrix, with dimension d by d}

\item{Ve}{current value of error covariance matrix, with dimension d by d}

\item{Dmat}{a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of the kinship matrix, K = UtDU}

\item{y}{a d by n matrix of phenotype values}
